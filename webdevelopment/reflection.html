                <p>“Dart Records is an eclectic collective of people who have different goals and different creative ideas that come together,” said founding member Arjuna Raghu. “The collective is open to anyone with a musical vision, and is working to build a community of musicians of all varieties.”</p>
                    
                <p>The group is focused on arts engagement opportunities and how art and music interact with our daily lives.They encourage others to be active members in Columbia’s art community by promoting and hosting events. They use music, art, design and physical spaces to bring their ideas to life.</p>

                <p>“I think having types of events that have to do with music and art are really important,” said Raghu. “If they want to expand on their interest, or show other people that interest, we’ll be receptive and go along with their idea, even if it's not something we know anything about. We just want to get into what they’re into.” </p>
                        
                <p>Other members of the organization felt the same way, appreciating the space that Dart Records creates. “It’s important to have interesting events, like ones where we do art or just get together and play music. I feel like it's good to have those artsy spaces,” said founding member Molly Hume.</p>
